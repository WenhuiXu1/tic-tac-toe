# Tic Tac Toe
A simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It features a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking the cells with their respective symbols until one player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of three symbols or the game ends in a tie.

### How to play
- Open the game.
- Click on any empty cell to mark it with your symbol (X or O).
- Alternate turns with the other player until one wins or the game ends in a tie.
- If you win, a message will be displayed to congratulate you. If the game ends in a tie, a message will be displayed to inform you.
- To restart the game, reload the page.
## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
I started by creating the basic HTML structure of the game, which consists of a title, a grid of nine boxes and a script file that handles the game logic. I then used CSS to style the boxes and the grid. Finally, I wrote the JavaScript code to handle the game mechanics, such as updating the board state, checking for wins and ties, and alternating turns between players.
##Flow charts of app logic.
start --> initialize variables --> add event listeners --> wait for user input 

wait for user input --> check if move is valid --> update board array --> check for winner or tie --> change player --> wait for user input

...

check for winner or tie --> end game
## :rocket: Cool tech
This project uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks. It showcases the power of these core web technologies and their ability to create interactive user interfaces and simple games.
