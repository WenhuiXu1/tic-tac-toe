# Tic Tac Toe
A simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It features a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking the cells with their respective symbols until one player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of three symbols or the game ends in a tie.
